Docker
A container technology. A tool for creating and managing containers.


Container
A stardardized unit of software. A package of code and dependencies to run that
code.

The same container always yields the exact same application and behavior. No
matter where or by whom it might be executed.

Support for containers is built into modern operating systems.

Docker simplifies the creation and management of such containers.


Why Containers?
Why would we want independent, stardardized "application packages"?

    Different Development & Production Environments
    We want to have the exact same environment for development and production.
    This ensures that it works exactly as tested
    
    Different Development Environments Within a Team / Company
    It should be easy to share a common development environment / setup with 
    new employees and colleagues

    Clashing Tools / Versions Between Different Projects
    We don't want to uninstall and re-install local dependencies and runtimes
    all the time
