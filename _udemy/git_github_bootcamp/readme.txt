Version Control System
Software that tracks and manages changes to files over time. Generally, it
allows users to revisit earlier versions of the files, compare changes between
versions, undo changes, etc.


Git Bash
Default shell for Linux and Mac. Git was designed to run on a Unix-based
interface (like Bash).

Windows comes with a different default command-line interface called Command
Prompt, which is not Unix-based.

Git Bash is a tool that emulates a Bash experience on a Windows machine.


Repository
A Git "Repo" is a workspace that tracks and manages files within a folder.


Staging Area
A place where changes are gathered before committing. It allows you to review
and organize changes before saving them in the repository.


Atomic Commits
When possible, a commit should encompass a single feature, or fix. In other
words try to keep each commit focused on a single thing.


Amending Commits
Use git commit --amend to modify the last commit. This lets you update the
commit message or include additional changes without creating a new commit.
