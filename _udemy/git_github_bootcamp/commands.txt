Commands



ls -a
Lists all contents of a directory, including hidden files and directories.


git status
Gives information on the current status of a Git repository and its contents.


git init
Initializes a Git repo. This is done once per project, at the top-level folder
containing your project.


git add
git add .
Stages changes for the next commit. It adds modified or new files to the
staging area, preparing them to be included in the next commit.

The . will add all changes at once.


git commit -m "commit message here"
Saves staged changes to the repository's history. Each commit has a unique
ID and a message describing the changes.


git commit --amend
Modifies the most recent commit. It allows you to change the commit message
or add new changes without creating a new commit.


code .
Opens the current directory in Visual Studio Code.


git log --oneline
Shows a compact version of the commit history, displaying each commit as a
single line with its short hash and message.


git branch
Lists all branches in the repository. 


git branch <branch-name>
Creates a new branch based on the current HEAD.


git branch -d <branch-name>
Deletes a local branch that has already been merged. It helps clean up old
branches after they've been integrated.


git branch -D feature-branch  
Forcefully deletes a local branch, even if it hasn't been merged. Use with
caution, as unmerged changes will be lost.


git branch -m <old-branch> <new-branch>  
Renames the branch to a new name.


git switch <branch-name>
Used to switch between branches or create a new branch. 


git switch -c <branch-name>  
To create and switch to a new branch.


git merge <branch-name>  
Combines changes from one branch into another. Typically used to merge a
feature branch into the main branch. This merges feature-branch into the
current branch.


git diff
git diff <filename>
Compares staging area and working directory. It highlights what changes
have been made but not yet staged. It just shows unstaged changes.


git diff HEAD
git diff HEAD <filename>
Lists all changes in the working tree since your last commit. Both staged
and unstaged.


git diff --staged
git diff --staged <filename>
git diff --cached
git diff --cached <filename>
Shows the difference between the staging area and the last commit. It
shows what changes you’ve staged (with git add) but haven’t committed yet.


git diff <branch-a> <branch-b>
git diff <branch-a>..<branch-b>
git diff <branch-a>...<branch-b>
Compares two branches and shows what is different in branch-b compared to
branch-a. Useful for reviewing changes before merging.

Double dot will show the commits in branch-b that are not in branch-a.
So it may exclude commits further up branch-a if it has had commits pushed
afterwards.

Triple dot will show all differences between branch-a and branch-b from the
point they were split.


git diff <commit-a>..<commit-b>
git diff <commit-a>...<commit-b>

Double dot shows changes in commit-b not in commit-a. Excludes changes unique
to commit-a.

Triple dots shows changes between the tips of both branches since their common
ancestor.


git stash
Saves uncommitted changes for later and reverts to a clean working directory.
You can add multiple stashes onto the stack of stashes. They will all be 
stashed in the order you added them.


git stash pop
Applies the most recent stash and removes it from the stash list.


git stash apply
Applies the most recent stash but leaves it in the stash list. This can be 
useful if you want to apply stashed changes to multiple branches.


git stash apply stash@{2}
Applies a specific stash from the list without removing it.


git stash list
Shows a list of all stashed changes with their stash IDs.


git stash drop stash@{2}
Deletes a specific stash entry from the stash list.


git stash clear
Deletes all stash entries.


git checkout <branch-or-commit>
Switches to a branch or restores files from a specific commit. This can
cause a detached head state to occur.


git checkout HEAD~1
Checks out the commit one before HEAD, entering detached HEAD state.


git switch -
Exits detached HEAD state by switching back to previous branch.


git switch master
git switch main
Exits detached HEAD state by switching back to the master branch.


git checkout HEAD <filename>
git checkout -- <filename>
Restores the file to its last committed state, discarding local changes.


git restore <filename>
Restores the file to the last committed state, discarding local changes.
Last state is based on the HEAD.


git restore --source HEAD~1 <filename>
Restores the file to its state in the commit one before HEAD.


git restore --staged <filename>
Unstages the file, keeping its changes in the working directory.


git clone <url>
Creates a local copy of a remote repository.


git fetch
Downloads changes from the remote repository without merging them.


git remote
git remote -v
Lists the short names of configured remotes.


git remote add <name> <url>
Adds a new remote repository with a given name and URL.


git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>
Renames a remote reference.


git remote remove <name>
Removes a remote reference from the repository.


git push
git push origin master
git push origin main
Pushes changes to the default remote repository and branch.


git push <remote> <branch>
Pushes the specified branch to the remote repository.


git push <remote> <local-branch>:<remote-branch>
Pushes local branch to a different branch name on the remote.


git push -u <remote> <branch>
Pushes and sets the upstream branch for future git push/pull. Once this is set
we can use `git push` for shorthand.
