cat 1>> test_file.txt
Appends standard output (stdout) from `cat` to test_file.txt. The `1>>` means 
"append stdout" (file descriptor 1) rather than overwrite.


cat 1>> test_file.txt 2>> error_file.txt
Appends standard output (stdout) to test_file.txt and appends standard error 
(stderr) to error_file.txt. Useful for saving both outputs separately.


cat 0<input.txt
Reads standard input (stdin) for `cat` from input.txt using file descriptor 0.
Same as `cat < input.txt`, but explicitly uses fd 0.


cat 0< input.txt > /dev/pts/2
Reads input from input.txt (stdin) and sends output to /dev/pts/2, which is a 
terminal device (usually another user’s terminal or a second session).


date | cut --delimiter " " --fields 5 1> time.txt
Gets the current date, extracts the 5th field (usually the time), and writes 
it to time.txt. Standard output (stdout) is redirected using file descriptor 1.
